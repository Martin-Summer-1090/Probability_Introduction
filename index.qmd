## What are these lecture notes about {-}

These lecture notes support the course An Introduction to Probability - with Applications 
to Computational Finance using R. The course introduces essential probability concepts that 
every finance practitioner must understand. As probability is crucial for solving financial 
problems computationally, we will use computational finance as the context to develop these 
ideas. The focus will be hands-on learning, enabling you to understand and internalize 
concepts by applying them yourself.

To make abstract concepts like randomness, chance, and probability more accessible, we will 
leverage computational tools, in our course this will be R, and visualizations built by using R. By actively engaging with 
these tools, you’ll not only deepen your understanding of probability but also enhance 
your ability to apply it to real-world finance problems.

## Key learning objectives

1. Understand foundational probability concepts.
2. Apply probability principles to solve computational finance problems.
3. Gain hands-on experience using R for probability and finance applications.
4. Develop proficiency in interpreting and visualizing probabilistic data.

:::

But how can we build abstract concepts such as probability, random phenomena and chance by 
our own hands? 
While probability is a mathematical theory, it gains practical value and an intuitive meaning in
connection with real or conceptual experiments such as, the future change in a stock price
index, the future value of a portfolio of securities, the chance that a creditor is not going
to be able to pay back your loan.

Many of these experiments we can nowadays simulate on the computer. We
can can construct, build and simulate a huge variety of random phenomena. We can - for instance - 
implement models of random fluctuations of asset prices. We can model financial risks
and contemplate possible future scenarios through simulation.

The arrival of the computer has been indeed a sea change for the mathematics of probability 
because it allows both reflecting about probability through theorems and proofs as well as
by making use of computer simulation. 
We can approach our understanding of abstract concepts
by building them with our own hands on the computer. This is the approach to teaching you
probability in this course.

Let me give you one example right away. Don't worry if you do 
not understand precisely what the following snippet
of code is doing. We will learn the syntax of
the R language as we go along. This is just to
demonstrate you what I explained in words 
before by a simple example highlighting simulation
of random processes and visualization.

::: {.callout-tip}
## An R example for illustration

```{r}
# Simulate daily returns for a stock

set.seed(123)  # Ensure reproducibility
n <- 100       # Number of days
daily_returns <- rnorm(n, mean = 0.001, sd = 0.02)  # Normal distribution

# Compute cumulative returns
price <- cumprod(1 + daily_returns) * 100  # Starting price = 100

# Visualize the stock price
plot(price, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2,
     main = "Simulated Stock Price",
     xlab = "Days", ylab = "Price")

```

:::

This example highlights:

* How randomness influences stock price movements
* R's usefulness in simulations and visualization.

It is, however important to always keep in mind that the
real world is different from the theory world as well as from 
the simulated world. The real world is both richer 
and more complex than both theory and simulation. It may contain features which need to be be 
taken into account for the 
explanation of phenomena which are absent in theory or in 
the simulation. We will try our best to develop
your feeling for the difference, between theoretical concepts, simulations and applications as well
as for the interdependence of these three areas.

There are many ways to build virtual objects and to run simulations to manipulate 
them. For this we will need a programming language. The language we choose for this
course is R and the integrated development environment RStudio. This is one of the main
languages used in data analysis, statistics and data science and is widely used in industry and 
academia. It will be our tool to do probability in this course.

Since this course was being taught the first time new AI tools such as large language models
(LLMs) like chatGPT, Claude or Gemini have been introduced. These new powerful tools
create new opportunities for learning and reinforcing knowledge such as the
concepts learned in this course. In this year I will show you
throughout the course, how you can leverage AI tools like ChatGPT for enhancing your learning experience. 
I encourage you to use these tools to generate examples, explain concepts, and debug R code or perhaps translate R code into a language you might be more familiar with on the fly to help you understand how things are expressed in R.

## Using an LLM to Enhance Your Learning Experience

In these lectures I try to help you building experience how to
integrate large language models  or LLMs into your learning and study 
process as well as to
support you in coding and programming. There are several such models
currently on the market. For this course I will use openAI's chatGPT
as a tool. ChatGPT is available in a free version and in an enhanced
pay-version. 

Throughout this course, you’ll learn how to use ChatGPT to support your studies. As a tool, it offers capabilities that can make learning probability more interactive and engaging. Here’s how you can leverage it:

- **Clarify Concepts**:  
  Ask ChatGPT to explain concepts in simple terms or elaborate on topics you find difficult:
  
  > "Explain the concept of a probability distribution with an example."

- **Generate Examples**:  
  Use it to create additional examples for practice:
  
  > "Can you give me an example of a random variable and how it applies in finance?"

- **Debug R Code**:  
  If you encounter issues with your R code, paste the code and ask:
  
  > "Why does this R code not run, and how can I fix it?"

- **Practice Exercises**:  
  Request custom exercises:
  
  > "Create three exercises to practice calculating probabilities for dice rolls."

- **Simulate Interactive Discussions**:  
  Simulate discussions with ChatGPT to test your understanding:
  
  > "I think the variance of a constant is zero. Am I correct? Explain why or why not."

- **Learn Best Practices in R**:  
  Ask for tips to improve your coding practices:
  
  > "What are the best practices for writing clean and efficient R code?"

**Important Note**:  
While ChatGPT is a powerful learning tool, remember to verify the outputs, especially for complex calculations, and always critically evaluate its suggestions. One such tool you might consider for
cross checking is Wolfram | Alpha, which you can find here: https://www.wolframalpha.com/ in
a free version.

## Downloading and installing R {-}

So lets start by downloading and installing R first. R is an open source project maintained
by an international team of developers. The software is made available through a website called
the comprehensive R archive network (http://cran.r-project.org).

At the top of this website, in a box named "Download and install R" you will find three
links for downloading R. Choose the link that describes your operating system, Windows, Mac or 
Linux. These links will lead you to the necessary information you need to install a current
version of R. The easiest install option is to install R from precompiled binaries. There is also
the option to built R from source on all operating systems if you have the tools and the
expertise to do so. R also comes both in a 32-bit and a 64-bit version. It does not make
a substantial difference which version you use. 64-bit versions 
can handle larger files and data sets with fewer memory management problems.

## Downloading and installing RStudio {-}

RStudio is an application that helps you write and develop R code. It makes using
R much easier for you than using it in isolation. The interface of RStudio looks the
same across all operating systems.

You can download RStudio for free from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. 
Select the box RStudio Desktop and follow the download instructions. RStudio Desktop is free.
Note that you need to have a version of R installed to use RStudio.

If you have successfully installed R and RStudio, we are ready to start.

Throughout this course I will use R with RStudio and when I do code
demonstrations I will use this environment. R can be used in many other
ways of course. Some of you might be accustomed to work with
Jupyter Notebooks. I will just mention here that with some minor
tweaks R can be used with Jupyter notebooks as well. I will not
go into the details here. Those of you who are interested in such a
setup are encouraged to ask chatGPT: 

> "Please give me a step by step instruction how to set up the system 
> to use R through Jupyter notebooks instead of RStudio."

## Signing up for ChatGPT (Free Version)

To access the free version of ChatGPT, follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Creat a free account" button to create an account. You can sign up 
using an email address or your existing Google or Microsoft account.
3. Follow the prompts to verify your email address and complete the registration process.
4. Once registered, log in to access ChatGPT. You can start using it immediately for your learning needs.

Using ChatGPT is free, but note that certain features or advanced versions (e.g., GPT-40) may require a paid subscription. 
The free version (GPT-3.5) is sufficient for getting a feeling of what the LLM can do. They payed version is more powerful.


## Prerequisites {-}

This course is built as an intuitive and elementary introduction to the field. No knowledge
of probability or R is assumed and all concepts are built from scratch. You should be able to study for this course by relying on the slides
and these lecture notes only without having to consult a textbook
or further literature.

Many of you will
have heard or studied probability at some stage in college or at university. I hope the
course will appeal to the newcomers as well as to the experienced. While it should allow the first
group to quickly learn some of the most important concepts and raise your curiosity and
excitement about a field of knowledge which is both beautiful and immensely practical, I hope it
will open a new perspective for the more experienced among you and thus help deepening
your understanding of concepts you might already have heard elsewhere.

The lectures develop probability concepts and R concepts in
parallel. This follows the idea underlying this course to develop
your knowledge of probability concepts by building them on the
computer yourself and play with them. In this way we hope to build
your R skills more thoroughly because they appear in a natural 
context and that this context also reinforces your understanding
of probability.

## Structure of the Notes {-}

The notes are structured into five main chapters. The idea is to cover
each main chapter topic in one of the five double units allocated to
this course.

Each of the main chapters or lectures are followed by a so called
*project*. The projects are meant to be worked on by you in the 
assigned groups between the lectures and should help you 
to practice and to deepen what you have learned. We will discuss
the project questions at the end of each lecture. We will also
distribute a worked problem after you have worked on it yourself.

We begin the first lecture, **lecture 1**  by discussing 
some of the main basic
probability fundamentals by putting them in their historical context
where the first ideas appear of how you could measure something such 
elusive as *chance* at all. Surprisingly these first simple ideas
are already very rich and lead us quite far into the field and its
problems. 

In this lecture we will also give a first panoramic run 
down of what you can do with R. In this lecture the first 
application will be a simple game of chance, the tossing of a coin. 
Already this very elementary example has direct relevance for 
computational financial modelling of security prices as we will
learn throughout the course.
 
Even the very basic ideas of probability and R enable us, already 
at this early stage, to take on a serious real world 
problem as well. In fact, with only a few intuitive concepts we can study and understand problems of the chance of coincidences. This
class of problems is at the heart of the science of constructing 
cryptographically safe
finger prints, so called hash-functions, which are at the heart of
crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. 

The first project will deal with engineering secure transaction indentifiers for 
a digital payment system and study how the construction of such identifiers has
to take into account key system paramaters such as transaction volume and number
of participants in the payment system.

**Lecture 2** will introduce the first basic intuitive ideas a bit more
formally and also generalize them. In particular it explains the
basic ideas of how probability and frequencies of chance events are related.
We will discuss the power as well as
the limits of these ideas for applied work in probability.

In this lecture we will explain in detail how you can
use R to read, store and manipulate data. We also 
start working with stock market data and randomly fluctuating
asset prices and discuss how we can deepen our understanding of them
using probability and R. 

Project 2 will help you to train and practice your 
understanding of data manipulation in R by analyzing a real world
supervisory data set from the European Banking 
Authority EBA. We will
use a really cool empirical probability pattern on the empirical frequency of leading
digits - Benford's law - 
for checking whether 
the data could be trusted or do look fishy on purely probabilistic 
grounds.

In **Lecture 3** we will learn about the key concept of conditional
probability. This lecture contains lots of concepts but it is also
of key importance for understanding many problems in Finance and
the management of financial risks. We will explain how the 
misunderstanding or perhaps willful ignorance of the concept of
*dependence* is at the root of the big financial crisis of 2007-2008. 
We will also learn, how updating your probability assessments in the light of
new data is important for 
investment decisions. 

On top of this directly practical 
considerations, we will also learn how this particular problem of
updating probability assessments in the light of new information helps
us close a conceptual gap in the pure frequency interpretations of
probability. 

In terms of R this lecture gives you a bit of a break
in the sense that it applies what we have learned before and
thereby reinforces what we have already learned. It will introduce
some useful techniques and functions along the way. 

In project 3 you will
deepen your understanding of how probability updating works and how
its sound understanding can make a real difference for the
success of investment decisions.

**Lecture 4** will introduce you more precisely to the key
probabilistic model of random returns and other random phenomena
in Finance: The concept of a random variable and the concepts of
expected value, variance, standard deviation, 
covariance and correlation. We will discuss at length the modelling
of random returns and learn about the basic workhorse model of asset
price dynamics, the binomial lattice. 

This discussion gives us also
the appropriate context to discuss how to write programs in R and
some of the principles and constructions that are most useful for
this task. 

In the project for lecture 4 you will learn about how you
can apply the ideas of random variables and the binomial distribution
to deepen your understanding of credit risk.

The final **Lecture 5** discusses the concept of continuous random
variables, which is very important for a large body of applied work. You will
be introduced to the normal distribution and its power and limits
for modelling random returns and financial risks. 

In terms of R this
lecture will provide a good context for discussing what matters when
you want to make your R code fast and efficient. 

The last project will
then allow us to connect all the concepts of the five lectures with
the project following lecture 4 to get a somewhat realistic and
practically useful model for analyzing and managing credit risk.

## Acknowledgements {-}

I would like to thank my friend and colleague Branko Urošević that he 
entrusted me to develop this course for his new and innovative program
in computational finance. 

I am very grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution to this
effort and for all the encouragement, support and advice I got from
him for this project. Of course he bears no responsibility whatsoever for
any shortcomings of these lecture notes.

I would also like to sincerely thank the former students of the bootcamp probability course who gave me feedback and studied from the lecture. They were
a fantastic and enthusiastic audience from who I learned a lot. 

## References {- #references}

When you teach such a fundamental field as probability theory and its
applications in Finance you teach from a core knowledge that has
been built by many pioneers, experts and other teachers in this area.
In this sense nothing contained in this course is original work. The
only contribution a teacher can make is the way how the material is
presented and combined. In this sense these lecture notes are nothing but
a collection of well known and time tested material as well as an
experiment in yet one more, hopefully innovative exposition. 

But even in this field I have copied and recycled a lot
from the teaching materials and collective wisdom of 
other colleagues whose examples and problems I found particularly
helpful. Without any claim to completeness let me briefly go through
the sources I have relied on most strongly when developing this course.

With respect to probability theory two sources have influenced me
most and I have followed their example extensively in this course: 
William Fellers "An introduction to probability 
theory and its applications volume 1." which first appeared in 1957. 
(@Feller1968). While really old
by now it is still in my view one of the most outstanding 
reference with respect to exposition and clarity of explanation as well as
an inspiring source of enthusiasm for the subject. I just would like to mention as an
aside that Feller (born Vilibald Srećko Feller) was a Croatian emigrant to
first Germany and then the US in the 1930ies. You might claim him as a citizen of Croatia,
former Yugoslavia or even Austria, since when he was born in 1906, what is now
Croatia was still a part of the Austrian-Hungarian empire. 

My second most important
source for this course in terms of probability was 
Karl Schmedder's course "An intuitive introduction to 
probabiliy", which Karl developed for the online platform 
Coursera. I consider this course an outstanding didactical 
achievement and masterpiece. If you find this lectures fun, I can only 
encourage you to also do the course on Coursera, when you find time. It is
for a reason that Karl's course is the mostly viewed 
Coursera course from Switzerand.^[See https://www.coursera.org/learn/introductiontoprobability] 

In terms of R and R 
programming I have followed and copied a lot from Garett 
Grolemund's excellent book "Hands on programming with R".(@Grolemund2014) I 
encourage you to study this book. From it I have not 
only learned about one of the most excellent explanations of R concepts but also
the insight that these concepts are best explained within a very 
concrete and non trivial application context rather than in a 
patchy series of toy examples. 

With respect to Finance 
and investments I have relied on the excellent 
book by David Luenberger, "Investment Science". (@Luenberger2009) If you 
can get a hold of this fantastic work, I can only encourage you to get one
and have it on your shelf. It is a role model of 
clarity of exposition and has much more to offer 
than we can cover in this book. 

Finally with
respect to the history and the interpretations of 
probability, I have learned the most form the 
excellent book "10 great ideas about chance", by Persi 
Diaconis and Brian Skyrms. (@DiaconisSkyrms2019) If you find probability 
interesting or even fascinating I encourage you 
to read this book at some stage, if you find time. It is full
of highly interesting philosophical, mathematical, historical and fun
facts and ideas about this very rich subject.

But now, lets get straight down to the matter at hand.
