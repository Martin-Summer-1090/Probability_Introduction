## Introduction

In this project, we analyze the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan using **conditional probabilities** and **Bayes' Rule**. 
This project demonstrates the application of theoretical probability concepts and their practical 
implementation in R, providing insights into real-world financial risk assessment.

## Problem Setup

### Scenario
A bank is evaluating a loan application using historical data to estimate the likelihood of default. 
The borrower has a low credit score, and the bank has the following data:

1. **Default Rates**:
   - Probability of default for all customers: $P(D) = 0.04$.
   - Probability of non-default for all customers: $P(ND) = 0.96$.

2. **Evidence**:
   - Probability of a low credit score given default: $P(L|D) = 0.7$.
   - Probability of a low credit score given non-default: $P(L|ND) = 0.1$.

We aim to calculate the **posterior probability** of default given a low credit 
score, $P(D|L)$, using **Bayes' Rule**.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Compute $P(D|L)$ Using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule is given by:
$P(D|L) = \frac{P(L|D) \cdot P(D)}{P(L|D) \cdot P(D) + P(L|ND) \cdot P(ND)}$

Substitute the given values:
$P(D|L) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.04}{0.7 \cdot 0.04 + 0.1 \cdot 0.96} = \frac{0.028}{0.028 + 0.096} = \frac{0.028}{0.124} \approx 0.226$

Thus, the probability that the borrower will default given their low credit score is approximately **22.6%**.

### Step 2: Simulate the Scenario in R

We simulate customer data to verify the theoretical result. The following steps outline the simulation process:

#### Simulating Defaults and Credit Scores

```{r}
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility

# Parameters
p_default <- 0.04
p_low_given_default <- 0.7
p_low_given_non_default <- 0.1
n_customers <- 10000

# Simulate defaults
default <- sample(c(1, 0), size = n_customers, replace = TRUE, 
                  prob = c(p_default, 1 - p_default))

# Simulate low credit scores
prob_low_credit <- default * p_low_given_default + 
  (1 - default) * p_low_given_non_default
low_credit <- rbinom(n_customers, size = 1, prob = prob_low_credit)

# Combine data into a data frame
data <- data.frame(Default = default, LowCredit = low_credit)

```

#### Compute Simulated $P(D|L)$

```{r}
# Calculate P(D|L) from the simulated data
p_d_given_l_sim <- sum(data$Default == 1 & data$LowCredit == 1) / 
  sum(data$LowCredit == 1)
p_d_given_l_sim
```

The simulated probability $P(D|L)$ should closely match the theoretical 
value of approximately **22.6%**.

---

### Step 3: Visualize Results

To compare the theoretical and simulated results, we create a simple bar plot:

```{r}
# Theoretical result
p_d_given_l_theory <- 0.7 * 0.04 / (0.7 * 0.04 + 0.1 * 0.96)

# Bar plot
barplot(
  c(Simulated = p_d_given_l_sim, Theoretical = p_d_given_l_theory), 
  main = "Probability of Default Given Low Credit Score", 
  ylab = "P(Default | Low Credit)", 
  col = c("blue", "red")
)
```

The bar plot visually compares the simulated and theoretical probabilities, helping to validate our calculations.

## Extensions

To deepen understanding, consider these additional analyses:

1. **Impact of Changing $P(D)$**:
   - How does $P(D|L)$ change if the overall default rate ($P(D)$) increases or decreases?

2. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Explore how changes in $P(L|D)$ and $P(L|ND)$ affect $P(D|L)$.

3. **Real-World Context**:
   - Discuss how similar probability models are used in credit risk assessment and other financial applications.

---

## Summary

In this project, we:
1. Used **Bayes' Rule** to compute the posterior probability of default given a low credit score.
2. Simulated customer data to verify theoretical results.
3. Visualized and compared theoretical and simulated probabilities.

This exercise reinforced key probability concepts and demonstrated their practical application in finance. It also provided hands-on practice with R programming for probability analysis.
