# Conditional Probability

## Why neglecting conditional probability may be expensive: A case study.

To appreciate the significance of conditional probability, let us start with a simple but striking scenario from the world of finance. Imagine you are an investor trying to evaluate the safety of a bond portfolio. On paper, the bonds are rated highly by reputable agencies, and the portfolio looks diversified—a dream investment. However, during a global recession, a few defaults occur, and to your surprise, the entire portfolio begins to unravel, causing significant losses. How could this happen?

This seemingly safe portfolio turned risky because it underestimated the connections between events—a core idea tied to conditional probability. Conditional probability helps us analyze how the risk of one event changes given another has occurred. It enables us to model dependencies, a critical factor in real-world scenarios, particularly during financial crises.

Understanding these relationships isn't just an intellectual exercise—it’s crucial for preventing catastrophic losses. Whether you're pricing complex financial instruments, assessing credit risk, or making investment decisions, mastering conditional probability allows you to account for interconnected risks and avoid misleading conclusions based on oversimplified assumptions.

More generally conditional probability is the key instrument of probability theory that guides you in adjusting risk assessment when new information becomes available that was not there before.

With this motivation in mind, we now turn to a historical example that demonstrates the importance of understanding conditional probability: the financial crisis of 2007-2008. This crisis revealed how wrong assumptions about independence and neglect of dependence in events and conditional probabilities can lead to systemic failures in structured finance.^[ See @Tooze2018: For an engaging and comprehensive exploration of the great financial crisis of 2007 - 2008 and its causes and aftermath. It is highly recommended for deeper study.]

### Understanding Structured Finance: Bonds, Pools, and Tranches

Let us begin with a simplified overview of the basic ideas of structured 
finance and the engineering of specific risk profiles from a portfolio of 
risky bonds. This example will then illustrate all the basic ideas why
conditional probability is an important concept and how it helps us 
navigating complext real world situations. This example will also 
motivate our our more formal discussion.

### Bonds and Credit Risk

**Bond, face value, par value** : A **bond** is a financial instrument where 
the issuer agrees to pay the holder a specific amount, the **face value** or 
**par value**, at maturity. Bonds are widely used as fixed-income securities 
but carry the risk of default if the issuer faces financial difficulties.

To quantify this risk, bonds are rated by agencies such as Moody’s and 
Standard & Poor’s. Investment-grade bonds are considered low-risk, while 
speculative or "junk" bonds are riskier and more likely to default. Here is a summary of their rating schemes and what the ratings mean in words:

| Rating Category   | Moody's | Standard & Poor's |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| High grade        | Aaa     | AAA               |
|                   | Aa      | AA                |
| Medium grade      | A       | A                 |
|                   | Baa     | BBB               |
| Speculative grade | Ba      | BB                |
|                   | B       | B                 |
| Default danger    | Caa     | CCC               |
|                   | Ca      | CC                |
|                   | C       | C                 |
|                   |         | D                 |

### Pooling and Tranching: The Innovation

Structured finance emerged in the early 2000s as a way to manage risk 
through **pooling** and **tranching**. By pooling risky assets and dividing 
cash flows 
into "tranches" with distinct risk profiles, financial engineers created new 
bonds, including investment-grade securities, from portfolios of junk bonds. 
A major product of this innovation was the **mortgage-backed security (MBS)**.

### An Example 

Let us develop an intuitive understanding of structured finance and its
relation to probability through a simplified example, which I learned
from Karl Schmedder's course mentioned at the beginning.^[See https://www.coursera.org/learn/introductiontoprobability]

##### A Simple Event Tree for One Bond

Consider a single bond you can own today that pays €1 at maturity at some point
in the future. Time is often abbreviated as $t$ and the points in time
are symbolized by letting $t$ take different values like $t=0$ for today and
$t=1$ for a future point in time, say a year from today.

This bond has a 10% chance of default, meaning there is a 90% chance it 
will not default. With a default probability of 10%, this bond would likely 
receive a speculative grade rating, such as 'B' or 'B-' in the rating 
tables presented earlier. This poor rating reflects the significant 
risk of non-payment associated with such a bond, which could deter 
risk-averse investors and highlight its 'junk' bond status. 
The payoff is structured as follows:

- If the bond does not default (“N”), the payoff is €1.
- If the bond defaults (“D”), the payoff is €0.

This situation can be represented as a simple probability tree of
@fig-single_bond_event_tree

```{r fig-single_bond_event_tree, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Event tree for one bond', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/single_bond_event_tree.png')

```


The graph above visualizes the outcomes of a single bond. Each node represents a possible state of the bond at different times:

- $t=0$ is the starting point.
- $t=1$ No Default $N$ occurs with a probability of $P(N) = 0.9$.
- $t=1$ Default $D$ occurs with a probability of $P(D) = 0.1$.

You could see this in analogy to the toss of a coin with the difference
that both sides of the coin show with different probability.

#### Combining Two Bonds with Independence Assumption

We now combine two such bonds into a portfolio. The 
assumption of **independence** implies that the defaults 
of these bonds occur independently of each other. 

While this assumption simplifies calculations, it was 
historically used by financial engineers to justify creating 
tranches from risky portfolios. The reasoning was that 
diversification reduces the likelihood of joint 
defaults, making some tranches appear safer.

At the time, financial engineers relied on historical 
data and market conditions to argue for this independence. 
Defaults were often uncorrelated under normal economic 
conditions, and diversification was seen as a proven 
strategy for mitigating risk. For example, if bond 
defaults were driven by isolated 
events (such as company-specific issues), 
the assumption of independence seemed reasonable. 
Moreover, the packaging of diverse assets from different 
industries into portfolios strengthened the appearance of 
safety, as individual economic shocks were less 
likely to affect the entire portfolio simultaneously.

However, this reasoning neglected systemic risks. During economic 
downturns or financial crises, defaults often become highly correlated due 
to shared macroeconomic pressures, such as declining housing 
markets or credit tightening. For instance, in the lead-up to 
the 2008 financial crisis, rising mortgage defaults were driven 
by broader economic factors that impacted many bonds simultaneously.
WIth this in mind it would be not pausible to assume that bonds can
be stacked together in a portfolio without the default risks of one
being not pushed up by the default risk of others.

Even without the formal use of probability theory, financial 
engineers could have questioned whether diversification 
truly guaranteed independence in the context of systemic risks.

The idea that junk plus junk could be transformed into 
investment-grade bonds through pooling should have raised 
skepticism. Careful critical thinking—considering broader 
economic dependencies—would have revealed that this transformation was too 
good to be true. By ignoring these dependencies, financial 
engineers failed to see how small cracks in the system could 
cascade into systemic failures.^[ A famous voice at the time 
warning about the flawed reasoning
was Raghuram Rajan, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. 
He warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification, CDOs 
and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the 
underlying assets more widely. ]

But let us not jump ahead and try to see how the tree for two bonds looks like
when we assume independence in @fig-two_bond_event_tree.

```{r fig-two_bond_event_tree, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Event tree for two bonds with independent default risk', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/two_bonds_event_tree.png')
```

The outcome of combining two bonds can be represented as a double event tree, showing all possible combinations of defaults and no defaults at $t=1$:
picture here

#### Pooling and Tranching

When you look at this portfolio under the independence assumption there
seems to be room for reengineering the risk profile of this portfolio. In all
outcomes but in the one where both bonds default you can guarantee a payoff of
1. There remains an adverse outcome, where both bonds default in which case
you can pay out nothing. But under independence this risk is small. The
probability of this event - remember our treatment of independent events in the
first lecture - would be:
$P(D) \times P(D) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01$
Pretty low. For example assume that the probability of default refer to
the probability of the bond defaulting over a year, the usual time frame 
taken in ratings, this would be a one in a hundered years event. In $99%$ we
would get a sure payoff of 1.

So this is the idea. We **pool** the payoffs of both securities and define
two new securities by changing their payoff profile. The first one pays
always 1 except when both bonds default in which case this bond pays 0. The 
other one will always pay 0 except in the case where both bonds do not default.
This is under independence an event with probability $P(N) \times P(N) = 0.81$.
Rember the complementarity rule? This says that the second bond will thus have 
a default probability of $19$ % instead of $10%$ it would be close to
toxic junk now.

Here is picture how you can visualize this piece fo financial magic.

```{r fig-pooling-and-tranching, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Event tree for two bonds with independent default risk with pooling and tranching', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/pooling_and_tranching.png')

```

What is done here is that the aggregate payoffs of both bonds are collected
in a pool and new securities - called P - in this picture are issued against the
pool. One, the upper one is now an investment grade asset paying 1 in every state
except one and the other is a toxic junk bond paying always 0 except in one state.
Note that the investment grade status could be engineered under the
assumption that the risks are independent.

#### Pooling and Tranching without Independent Risks 

Now, let us consider a hypothetical question: 
**How would the event tree change if the independence assumption does not hold?** Dependence would alter the probabilities in a way that reflects 
the increased likelihood of joint defaults during systemic events.

Suppose we now assume that the probability of Bond 2 defaulting changes rather than staying unchanged under the condition that Bond 1 has defaulted:

- If Bond 1 does **not** default, Bond 2 defaults with probability 0.1 (as before).
- If Bond 1 **does** default, Bond 2 defaults with a higher probability 
of 0.6 due to systemic dependence.

This dependence reflects a scenario where defaults are more 
likely to occur together, such as during an economic downturn. 
The resulting event tree can be visualized as follows:

```{r fig-pooling-and-tranching-dependent, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Event tree for two bonds with independent default risk with pooling and tranching with dependent default risk', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/two_bonds_event_tree_dependent_events.png')

```

On the first sight this looks almost identical to the picture before. Only
the numbers on the edges of the second tree have changed. These changed numbers
reflect the idea that the event that one bond has defaultet changes the
probability of the second bond defualting as well. How could such a dependence
occur?

Here’s a real-world example to illustrate how dependence can occur:
In the context of bonds, dependence in default probabilities can 
arise from shared exposure to systemic risks or interconnected 
factors. For instance, consider two companies that 
issue bonds and operate in the same industry, such as 
the energy sector. If oil prices plummet due to an 
economic downturn or geopolitical instability, both 
companies might experience financial stress, making it 
more likely that one default is followed by another. 

Another example is during a financial crisis, such as the 
2008 global financial meltdown. A bank's default on its 
obligations can lead to cascading defaults in other 
institutions due to counterparty risks or a general loss 
of confidence in the financial system. In such cases, the 
probability of a second default is no longer independent 
of the first because the events are tied to the same underlying 
macroeconomic factors.

These examples highlight that the assumption of independence 
between bond defaults might hold under normal market conditions 
but breaks down during systemic crises. Such dependencies must 
be carefully modeled to avoid underestimating risk, as was 
the case in structured finance products leading up to the 2008 crisis.

A prudent risk manager must keep such a scenario in mind when he analyzes
a portfolio. Think about it in the context of the toy example. In the
first case the default risk of the first asset created by pooling and tranching
was $P(D) \times P(D) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01$. Under a scenario with
dependent risks this changes to $P(D) \times P(D | D) = 0.1 \times 0.6$, a risk
larger by a factor of 6! While the first bond would be rated as investment
grade, the second would be rated as speculative grade and the magic from
pooling and tranching suddenly disappears. Junk plus junk remains junk after 
all.

For pooling and tranching to reduce overall risk and create safe tranches:

1. **Diversification:** Assets must come from independent sectors with minimal systemic risk.
2. **Stable Macroeconomic Conditions:** Systemic risks must be low to maintain independence assumptions.
3. **Transparent Modeling:** Dependence structures must be explicitly modeled and accounted for in risk assessments.

The neglect of these conditions led to a flawed sense of security in structured finance, which contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.

## Conditional Probability

Conditional probability formalizes how the probability of one event 
changes when another event is known to occur, providing a 
framework for understanding dependencies quantitatively.

Here is the mathematical definition:

Conditional probability
: Let $A$ and $B$ be given events. We define the **conditional probability** 
of $A$ given $B$ as
\begin{equation*}
P(A\,|\,B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\,\,\, \text{provided}\,\,\, P(B) \neq 0
\end{equation*}

Note that for conditional probabilities we have for two events $A$ and $B$, that
$P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$.
To see this assume that $P(A) \neq P(B)$ and $P(A) \neq 0$ and
$P(B)\neq 0$. 

We then get:
\begin{equation*}
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(B)}
\end{equation*}
since $P(A \cap B) = P(B \cap A)$.
It follows that
\begin{equation*}
\frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(B)} \neq \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} = P(B|A)
\end{equation*}
since we
have assumed that $P(A) \neq P(B)$. 
Therefore $P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$.

As in the case of independent events the probability of
two events occuring simultaneously we use the
**multiplication rule**. The multiplication rule is the
AND rule of probability theory. In the general case
where dependence might occur we have to take into
account that the probability of events influence each
other. This requires a new notation, which we 
have iplicitly used before when discussing our
event tree.

Multiplication rule
: Given events $A$ and $B$ it holds that
\begin{equation*}
P(A \cap B) = P(A | B)\times P(B)
\end{equation*}

The notation $P(A | B)$ reads *probability of event $A$ given event $B$ has 
occurred*. With th multiplication rule can gain a deeper insight into 
the meaning of independence. Remember that two events $A$ and  $B$ are independent
if $P(A \cap B) = P(B \cap A) = P(A) \times P(B)$. 

If we combine this rule with the
concept of conditional probability, we see that if two 
events $A$ and $B$ are independent, then
\begin{equation*}
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A) \times P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
P(B|A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(A) \times P(B)}{P(A)} = P(B)
\end{equation*}

This formula says that if two events are independent the probability of $A$ is
not influenced by the event $B$ occurring and the probability of event $B$ is not
influenced by the event $A$ occurring.

Let's think about an example illustrating this fact. 
Suppose you are analyzing the stock prices of Company A and Company B. Let:

- $A$: The event that Company $A$’s stock price increases.
- $B$: The event that Company $B$’s stock price increases.

Now imagine the following situation:

1. **Strong Dependency**:
   - If Company B’s stock increases $B$, it often positively impacts Company 
   $A$ due to a business partnership. For example, $P(A|B) = 0.8$ (an 80% 
   chance of $A$’s stock rising if $B$’s stock rises).
   - However, the reverse relationship is weaker. If Company $A$’s stock rises 
   $A$, it may only slightly impact Company $B$ due to asymmetrical business dynamics. For example, $P(B|A) = 0.3$ (a 30% chance of B’s stock rising if $A$’s stock rises).

2. **Asymmetry**:
   - The probabilities are different because $P(A|B)$ measures how $A$’s stock depends on $B$’s movement, while $P(B|A)$ measures how $B$’s stock depends on 
   $A$’s movement. The strength and direction of influence are not necessarily the same.

 So why is $P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$:
 
- The events $A$ and $B$ have different relationships depending on which stock's movement is **caused by or influenced by** the other.
- In this case, $P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$ because Company $B$'s stock has a stronger influence on A’s stock than vice versa.

Think of $P(A|B)$ as asking, “If $B$ moves, how does $A$ behave?” versus $P(B|A)$, which asks, “If $A$ moves, how does $B$ behave?” The relationship is directional, and the influence is often unequal, leading to $P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$.
